# powerbi_internship2
Welcome to my Power BI internship repository! This repository contains projects completed during my internship, showcasing my proficiency in Power BI and data visualization techniques.

A Power BI dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas, that tells a story through visualizations. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the highlights of that story.

The visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles. You pin tiles to a dashboard from reports, and each report is based on a semantic model. 

A dashboard is an introduction to the underlying reports and semantic models.
